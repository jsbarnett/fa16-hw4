## Questions

1. What is the difference between new and create for a model?

Create will save the object to the database, new just creates it.

2. What command combined with new will emulate the same behavior as create?

If we were to use 'save' with new it would emulate create.

3. What is the default integer column that exists on every table but we did NOT define?

The default integer column is the 'id' column. We can override it but it is not conventional.

4. What single line of ruby code can insert a cat with the name "Kira" in the database?

The line of code is: 'Cat.create(:name => "Kira")'.

5. How did you like this homework in comparison with the previous homeworks?

So much fun to make our own db. :)
